# 8th-Python-Game
This is another numbers game. However I revamped the code using object oriented programming, a skill I've learned recently.
The game will ask you for a random number. It will check to make sure that number is valid then respond with higher or lower based on the senario.
Once you guess the number it will tell you how many guesses you used and ask if you would like to play again.
Made this from 330-530, 11/3/21 after a scary dream that had me screaming at what I thought was a figure in front of me, when I opened my eyes.
That was really just my knee in sweatpants.
